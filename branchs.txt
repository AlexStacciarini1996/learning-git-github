I learned about branches, how to create new branches and switch between them, and also how merging works
To create a new branch, you can use the command 'git branch *name*' OR 'git checoukt -b *name*' to create and switch to the new branch
git branch will show me all the branches
git branch -d *name* will delete the typed branch
git merge *name* will merge the current branch with the one typed
